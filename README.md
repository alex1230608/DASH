# DASH - Adaptive Weighted Traffic Splitting in Programmable Data Planes

This is a working project with a paper published in SOSR 2020. We uploaded our codes here for interested researchers to access. The codes here can be executed using mininet and bmv2. We conducted experiments on a private simulation tool instead of emulation tools like mininet to get a precise evaluation result. However, we share our p4 codes here to enable discussion.

The execution is similar to examples in p4lang/tutorial. In this setup, a leaf-spine topology with 4 leaves and 4 spines is used. Setups used in the paper like Figure 8 can be implemented by using different sender-receiver pairs.
